/**
 * Problem 59
 * 
 * An extract taken from the introduction of one of Euler's most celebrated
 * papers, "De summis serierum reciprocarum" [On the sums of series of
 * reciprocals]: I have recently found, quite unexpectedly, an elegant
 * expression for the entire sum of this series 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + etc.,
 * which depends on the quadrature of the circle, so that if the true sum of
 * this series is obtained, from it at once the quadrature of the circle
 * follows. Namely, I have found that the sum of this series is a sixth part of
 * the square of the perimeter of the circle whose diameter is 1; or by putting
 * the sum of this series equal to s, it has the ratio sqrt(6) multiplied by s
 * to 1 of the perimeter to the diameter. I will soon show that the sum of this
 * series to be approximately 1.644934066842264364; and from multiplying this
 * number by six, and then taking the square root, the number
 * 3.141592653589793238 is indeed produced, which expresses the perimeter of a
 * circle whose diameter is 1. Following again the same steps by which I had
 * arrived at this sum, I have discovered that the sum of the series 1 + 1/16 +
 * 1/81 + 1/256 + 1/625 + etc. also depends on the quadrature of the circle.
 * Namely, the sum of this multiplied by 90 gives the biquadrate (fourth power)
 * of the circumference of the perimeter of a circle whose diameter is 1. And by
 * similar reasoning I have likewise been able to determine the sums of the
 * subsequent series in which the exponents are even numbers.
